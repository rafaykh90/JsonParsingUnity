# JsonParsingUnity

1. I have used LitJson to parse json from the api and UnityWebRequest is used to fetch the json in string format from the api.
2. There are two scripts 'UIHandler' and 'JsonFetcher'. UIHandler script is user to interact with the UI as well as getting the data from the api with the help of the URL.
3. Search query is used to send program type with in the URL in order to get only the specific type of program list in Json String.
4. JsonFether is used to parse the JSONObject and return a list. The list contains the Finnish titles for the program type.
5. I have used the standard Unity 4.6 UI features in the Scene.
